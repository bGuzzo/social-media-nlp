people around globe causing potentially irreversible damage earth ecosystems. example, continuing ocean acidification rising water temperature endangering marine species, including coral reefs, considered rainforest sea biodiversity support. avoid worst effect climate change, set paris agreement, global greenhouse gas emission need peak 2025 decline 43 per cent 2030, falling net zero 2050. instead, current voluntary national commitment climate action, greenhouse gas emission rise nearly 14 per cent 2030. concurrently, world witnessing largest number violent conflict since 1946, one quarter global population living conflict-affected countries. may 2022, record 100 million people forcibly displaced homes. outbreak war ukraine caused food, fuel fertilizer price skyrocket, disrupted

range issues. yet level response among national statistical system differed widely. already solid well-established data system better equipped react creatively crisis. moreover, path success always
