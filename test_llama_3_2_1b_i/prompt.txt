==================================================
Generate a semantic graph representing the relationships between the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  
Output the graph as a list of edges in the format: `(SDG_A, RELATIONSHIP, SDG_B)`.  
Focus on direct and strong relationships; avoid weak or indirect connections.  
The relationships should be descriptive and concise, using terms like "supports," "contributes to," "is essential for," "conflicts with" (when applicable), or similar.  
Do not include self-referential edges (e.g., (SDG_1, supports, SDG_1)).  
Ensure the relationships are well-justified based on the known interlinkages between the SDGs.  
For example, a valid edge might be `(SDG_7, contributes to, SDG_8)`, representing how access to affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) contributes to decent work and economic growth (SDG 8).

=====================================================
Generate a detailed semantic graph representing the interconnectedness of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The graph should be represented as a list of edges, where each edge is expressed as a tuple: `(Node1, Relationship, Node2)`.  

Include at least three additional related concepts for each SDG as nodes (e.g., for SDG 1: No Poverty,  additional nodes could be "Poverty Rate", "Income Inequality", "Access to Healthcare"). 
Relationships should be descriptive and precise (e.g., "contributes to", "is impacted by", "requires", "leads to").  
Prioritize relationships that highlight causality, interdependence, and conflict between goals.  
The output should be a comprehensive list of these edges, aiming for a depth and breadth of connections that reflect the complex interrelationships between the SDGs and their related concepts.  
Ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity in the relationships used.
